#### Project Abstract

LyfeOn is an interactive web application which will take active user data to recommend proper nutrition and lifestyle habits to enhance users overall health. After an initial assessment when the user first creates their account, the application will then use a series of recommendation algorithms and calculations to curate an individualized experience, an exciting way to make health an easy goal for any user to maintain.
