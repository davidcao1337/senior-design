#### Justification of Hours

All team members attended weekly meetings and sometimes a second meeting will be schedule that same week. Weekly Stand-Up Meetings would typically last half an hour (30 Minutes). Meetings where we would meet to work on an assignment or work on the project would be about 1 hour long.
Most of the Fall Semester was spent on planning, learning, and researching (hence the sparse commit history that term). The Spring Semester is where we started working on the code implementation of our plans and designs. Please refer to git commit history as proof of work.
Links to some of the learning materials and meeting notes can be found in the Appendix.
