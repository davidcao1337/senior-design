## Constraints

### Time
There is a major time constraint with this project as we are limited to 2 semesters to complete it. In addition, we as students have to balance between working on the project as well as attending classes (completing assignments and exams). Coordinating everyone’s schedule is also a challenge as some tasks require everyone to be present at a particular time. We have the project timeline planned out, but things can change or some things take longer than expected to complete.

### Economic
Funding can be a potential issue for us. It may limit the scope of the entire project and use of technologies. We are working with free development tools and resources, some functions may be limited with free versions. Our plan for the project is to host the web app online but it will depend on the quality of the free hosting platforms.

### Security
Since our app collects and manages user data, it’s important that we protect the privacy of our users. We collect sensitive information such as the user’s full name, email, health data (weight, height), etc. We will not sell any of our user’s data to third parties. We will also have robust privacy settings and make it transparent to our users on how we manage and use their data.
