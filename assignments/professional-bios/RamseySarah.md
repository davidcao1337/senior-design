-- Made extensive use of declarative React, including stateless components, to promote efficient rendering, cross-platform compatibility, and extensible component design.
-- Made use of CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins and Gitlab for a seamless development workflow.
-- Ensured new development adhered to DRY principles.
-- Created asset streams of existing and proposed logic, calculated efficient means of determining change, and transpiled the result into machine-readable instructions.
