# Developer Guide

## Getting Started

### `npm install`

This will install dependencies and packages necessary for the app to run. This command will need to be run in both the client and server directories.

### `npm run dev`

This will run the server and client simultaneously, avoiding the need for two runs in seperate terminals.

### Routes Handler

These are the different routes that the backend API can serve to the frontend.
