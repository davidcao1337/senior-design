# Developer Guide

## Getting Started

### Linux/Unix:
### `bash install_packages.sh`

### Windows (Powershell):
### `.\install_packages.bat`

This script will install dependencies and packages necessary for the app to run.

### `npm run dev`

This will run the server and client simultaneously, avoiding the need for two runs in seperate terminals.

### Routes Handler

These are the different routes that the backend API can serve to the frontend.
